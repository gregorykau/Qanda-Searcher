    EDIT: This project hasn't been worked on since 2019 before I graduated, and the Q&A website has since been updated rendering the scraper defunct.

    Nonetheless, it's still fun quote searching. Enjoy!

<h3>What's this?</h3>
<hr />
<p>While the ABC's official Q&A website provides transcripts for all episodes from 2009 onwards,
    they're presented in a largely static format. This project aims to provide an alternative presentation which
    places greater emphasis on interactivity.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Background</h3>
<hr />
<p>
    This project started as an assignment for a data visualization unit at Monash University. The aim was
    to create an interactive visualization from an existing data-set to tell a narrative. Unfortunately,
    no pre-processed data-sets for Q&A existed. A web-scraper was therefore written to automatically retrieve details
    from the online transcripts (audience voting, panelist/audience names etc.) allowing for the generation of associated
    statistics and visualizations.
</p>
<br />
<h3>Ongoing development goals</h3>
<hr />
<ol>
    <li>Produce visualization for political party representation among the panel</li>
    <li>Refinement of transcripts, correcting any errors made in parsing and those present in the original ABC pages</li>
</ol>
<br />
<h3>Disclaimer</h3>

<p>
    The Q&A transcripts are property of the ABC, I claim no ownership over them or any of the associated
    images and resources used from the ABC's website. This project is purely a labour of love, I don't
    seek to derive any financial profit. Additionally, this project is open-source and can be found on GitHub.
